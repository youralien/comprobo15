1. How might rosbag fit into a debugging process as you work on projects in this class?
Rosbag will help us capture and replay all the information being published to topics during a robot run.  This ability to replay will help with being able to rerun under exact conditions in order to debug.  In addition, by ros bagging many topics, we can investigate a certain topic in one session, and then revisit the same robot state in a different topic the next.  This allows us to keep consistency, while managing many different topics.

2. Are there any obvious shortcomings of rosbag as a debugging tool?
Rosbag is a virtual version of the real neato running. Thus, it suffers from the same disadvantages of debugging robots (you can't step through lines, per say)

3. Does the new behavior of changing the fixed frame make sense?
Yup, the frame really just changes the position of the Robot Model.  The odom frame still rotates exactly as it did before.
